ACLU and Planned Parenthood lay out the long history of Alabama \u2019 s attempts to restrict abortions and argues that the serious health risk exception is tailored so narrowly as to be impossible to comply with.","West seemed to hold nothing back in the interview and, at one point, singled out Planned Parenthood, which he said has `` been placed inside cities by White supremacists to do the Devil \u2019 s work.","I thought about that rule of thumb as I read about the elaborate media hoax ginned up by the Center for Medical Progress, a right-wing group trying to discredit and defund Planned Parenthood.","Wen and Planned Parenthood were involved in weeks of negotiations around her departure, and the board announced the meeting internally a week ago, according to a source familiar with the matter.","However, when the videos were released online last year, Planned Parenthood claimed selective editing had created a misperception.","If the group \u2019 s executives were serious about women \u2019 s health, they would \u2019 ve chosen to maintain federal funding, adapting to the rule and financially distinguishing abortion procedures from the rest of the group \u2019 s work.","Abby Johnson, among the most sought-after motivational speakers in the anti-contraceptive movement after walking out of Planned Parenthood a decade ago, was at one point a high-profile Obria employee.","Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging a new law in Alabama that bans most abortions in the state, save those to prevent a serious health risk to the mother.","\u2014 Kansas became the first state Tuesday to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus.","Taking a page from the falsehoods and selectively-edited videos that brought about the defunding and bankruptcy of the left-wing advocacy group ACORN, the Center for Medical Progress strategy is to create a narrative, claim that its videos constitute damning evidence, and repeat that story enough times to give politicians the `` proof '' they need to attack Planned Parenthood.","Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) made similar promises to file an amendment that would, according to the Hill, `` eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. ''Planned Parenthood receives more than $ 500 million annually in government funding, mostly through Medicaid and grants.","Republican legislators have repeatedly tried to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 questioning why the non-profit gets money from the government in the first place.","Jeb Bush said he was opposed to a shutdown of the federal government proposed by some congressional Republicans in their fight to defund Planned Parenthood \u2013","Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama Friday over the state \u2019 s near-total abortion ban \u2014 which is exactly what Alabama Republicans wanted.","Planned Parenthood is an industrial-scale baby abattoir responsible for more than 300, 000 American deaths annually and a degradation of human dignity on the order of Josef Mengele, and the urgent issue of the day is whether it should be privately or publicly funded.","Leaders of the nation 's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, are obviously upset, calling the policy `` unethical, illegal, and harmful to public health. ''","Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, the first physician to head the women \u2019 s health care group in 50 years, said she was removed from her position by the organization \u2019 s board at a secret meeting, capping months of internal concerns over her management style and a perceived shift away from the group \u2019 s political work.","Planned Parenthood, with its roots in early-20th-century eugenics, is the keystone institution in the progressive social movement that has set about to overthrow the notion that religious doctrine, cultural custom, or even biological fact might impose upon a person some duty they can not shake off.","The abortion precedent he is discussing is the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey and 2018 's National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, where the US Supreme Court held `` that the First Amendment has a limited role to play in allowing doctors to avoid making truthful mandated disclosures related to informed consent, '' and the ultrasound law `` provides relevant information '' that `` gives a patient greater knowledge of the unborn life inside her. ''`` This also inherently provides the patient with more knowledge about the effect of an abortion procedure: it shows her what, or whom, she is consenting to terminate, '' Bush continued.","In fact, just 27 percent of Americans side with Planned Parenthood, Mr. Obama, and the Democratic Party platform in believing abortions should always be legal.","The recently fired president of Planned Parenthood, Leana Wen, accused the nation \u2019 s single largest abortion provider of hypocrisy and lack of care for women \u2019 s health in an angry letter to the group \u2019 s board of directors, made public over the weekend.","President Obama is delivering a generous parting gift to Planned Parenthood in the form of a rule prohibiting states from divesting millions of dollars from the nation \u2019 s largest abortion provider.","A Houston grand jury investigating criminal allegations against Planned Parenthood stemming from a series of undercover videos on Monday instead indicted two of the anti-abortion activists who shot the footage.","Planned Parenthood confirmed the news in a press release, announcing that Alexis McGill Johnson, cofounder of the anti-bias research group Perception Institute and Planned Parenthood board member, will temporarily replace Wen until a new president is installed.","According to the administration \u2019 s brief, abortion providers should not be able to assert the rights of their patients because the providers \u2019 interests are potentially in conflict with the interests of those patients.","Now, instead of working to get a late-term abortion ban and other legislation through Congress, pro-life activists like Quigley are refocusing on keeping tax dollars out of the hands of Planned Parenthood.","These accounts by former clinic staff have shell-shocked the nation, and it is incumbent upon the president to reconsider his support for the abortion industry and Planned Parenthood, which last year profited from abortion $ 87 million committing over 300, 000 abortions, said Lila Rose, who heads Live Action, an anti-abortion group.","At Trust Women, a network of women 's healthcare clinics and one of Oklahoma 's three abortion providers, the dilation and evacuation abortion method is `` absolutely the most common '' protocol for women seeking the procedure in their second trimester, said Julie Burkhart, the co-founder and chief executive officer of the clinic network.","Wen attributed her departure to philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood, she said in a tweet on Tuesday.","The ACLU has long been comfortable with the ultimate violence committed inside the nation \u2019 s abortion clinics on unborn children, for example.","Some of the rhetoric on the left about the awful shootings at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado is troubling.","Planned Parenthood reported receiving a record $ 542 million in taxpayer support in fiscal 2012, marking a steady increase in government funding despite Republican-led efforts at the state and federal levels to cut off that stream.","Pro-life groups quickly seized on the report to renew their calls for Congress to `` defund '' Planned Parenthood.","Planned Parenthood and ACLU sue in federal court over Alabama 's near-total abortion ban.","This is precisely the myth that Planned Parenthood and its activist allies have propagated in the wake of the Protect Life rule.","The administration has long assured Americans Obamacare does not subsidize abortion services, despite the White House 's close ties to abortion giant Planned Parenthood.","The dispute over Dr. Deborah Nucatola and her comments in a video secretly taped by anti-abortion activists means abortion - not a dominant issue in American politics for several years - could move front and center this fall as Republican lawmakers try to score political points on Planned Parenthood.","Planned Parenthood might as well stop wasting money on public-relations officials and marketing campaigns, because media outlets are only too willing to do their dirty work for free.","In a stunning turn of events, the grand jury declined to indict officials from the abortion provider, and instead handed up a felony charges of tampering with a government record against Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden and center employee Sandra Merritt.","Virginia Governor Ralph Northam simply blurted out the position Planned Parenthood has long counseled Democrats to take.","Planned Parenthood centers and supporters across the country took to Facebook and Twitter encouraging women to share how Planned Parenthood has helped them, using the hashtag # PPShoutYourStory.","In announcing Mr. Obama as speaker, Planned Parenthood, focused their praise on his work helping women gain greater access to contraception.","Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said Mr. Obama has done more than any president in history for women \u2019 s health and rights","House Republicans are threatening to subpoena a top Planned Parenthood official unless the group voluntarily makes her available for an interview about alleged sales of fetal tissue from abortions.","In the wake of sting videos taped inside Planned Parenthood clinics, Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) promised to use `` all legislative vehicles at his disposal '' to force a vote defunding the organization.","( That Johnson herself orchestrated something of a long-term cash grab when she fudged the circumstances of her exit from Planned Parenthood and built a small media empire on her story should not, however, go unrecognized.
