New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday there \u2019 s far too many people sitting in prisons for non-violent drug crimes and called on Republicans to focus on people not just before they \u2019 re born but after as well.","The ruling struck down laws banning abortion across the nation.","Two Democrats with close ties to Wall Street, Senators Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, declined to comment on Wednesday.","The statement by Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Louise Slaughter of New York is an attempt to salvage the Medicare deal struck by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker John A. Boehner, even as Senate Democrats air grievances about the so-called Hyde language on abortion and other aspects of the House package.","After much debate, the party conventioneers decided to strip opposition to gay marriage and abortion from the party platform, while they also endorsed Gov. Brian Sandoval for re-election.","The Republican-led Senate voted 19-14 along party lines to override Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe 's veto of the 20-week bill, a day after the GOP-led state House voted to override it.","`` We ca n't get around the fact that this is certainly a loss for the pro-life movement, that the House that has been a vanguard is now going to be back in the hands of someone like Nancy Pelosi who is absolutely an abortion radical, '' says Mallory Quigley with the Susan B. Anthony List ( SBA ).","Like the Reproductive Health Act in New York and the recently defeated abortion expansion in Virginia, the bill carefully avoids defining health.","Senate Democrats blocked two bills Tuesday aimed at banning abortions after 20 weeks and threatening prison for health care providers who don \u2019 t give medical aid to babies born after failed abortions.","Senate Republicans, led by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, are pushing for a federal ban on abortions after the end of the 20th week of pregnancy.","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is coming under fire from his home state colleague, Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY )","Here \u2019 s the math: Texas Democrats typically get a quarter of the white vote, which in 2014 would translate to about 15 percent of the overall vote.","But Mr. Romney would hardly be the first Republican nominee at odds with his party \u2019 s more absolute opposition to abortion.","The Republican majority ultimately passed the bill unchanged just before midnight, with all but one Democrat voting against it.","Fox News has the details: The Texas Senate late Friday passed tough new abortion restrictions after weeks of protests, sending them to Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law.","The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless, the vulnerable, and the marginalized, '' said Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ), the House majority leader, in a statement in September ( the House passed the bill in early October ).","In the wake of President Obama 's re-election, the public opinion dam has seemingly begun to burst on one hotly-contested social issue: Same-sex unions.","The 21 percent of respondents who said Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor in their vote went for Trump 56 to 41 percent.","The timing of the approval of the Republican anti-abortion plank was awkward for Mitt Romney, who has denounced Mr. Akin \u2019 s comments about rape and abortion and who has said that he supports exceptions to allow abortions in cases of rape.","While there are no exit-poll questions about the way voters \u2019 abortion views influenced their votes, two data points further elucidate this issue.","Despite efforts of conservative lawmakers and activists, the Ohio Legislature failed on Thursday to override a veto by Republican Gov. John Kasich on controversial abortion bill HB 258, also known as the fetal heartbeat ban, after passing it earlier this month.","The Republican half of the `` legitimate rape '' pile-on was a desperate, but ultimately failed attempt to portray Akin 's comments about rape as an unfortunate case of bad-appleism.","Meanwhile, the pro-abortion crowd and Senate Democrats are not happy with the bill \u2019 s passage: Democrats, though, promised a fight in the courts.","What other conclusion can one reach when 44 out of 47 Senate Democrats blocked the Senate from voting on a bill requiring that any baby who survives an abortion \u2014 in other words, a baby who was born \u2014 must be brought to a hospital for care and treated with the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.","Presidential hopeful Sen.
